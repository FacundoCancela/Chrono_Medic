A.E.O.N: Dr. Emilssen, before you begin your mission, let me explain the function of this portal.
A.E.O.N: It leads to the Class Training Room, a safe space where you can familiarize yourself with the abilities and mechanics of each class.
A.E.O.N: In this room, you can practice combat techniques, test out class-specific weapons, and experiment with their upgrades and ultimate abilities.
A.E.O.N: I highly recommend you take some time to train here before venturing through the other portals. Understanding your class and its potential can make a significant difference in your ability to survive and succeed.
A.E.O.N: Step through when you're ready, and remember, preparation is the key to victory.
