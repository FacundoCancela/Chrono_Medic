Child: Mom, can I buy that chocolate we saw in the store?
Mom: Which one? The one with the golden box?
Child: Yes! They say it's the most delicious in the world.
Mom: Well, we can try it. But remember, you can't eat it all at once!
Child: I promise! But can I have a little now?
Mom: Sure, but just a small piece. We need to share with Dad too.
Child: Yes! Dad loves chocolate as well.
