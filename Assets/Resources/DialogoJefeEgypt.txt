Anubis: "My time has come... I have fulfilled my purpose."
Emilssen: "What purpose are you talking about?"
Anubis: "The wheel of fate keeps turning. Do not fear, your victory only hastens the inevitable."
A.E.O.N.: "Quickly, don’t stop now! Use the syringe and take the sample of his genetic material. We need it to move forward."
Emilssen: "All of this... will it really be worth it?"
A.E.O.N.: "Time will tell, Emilssen. Time will tell... but for now, we must keep going. The fate of the world depends on it."
